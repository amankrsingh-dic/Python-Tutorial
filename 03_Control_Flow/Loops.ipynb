    "# Python Control Flow: Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python supports two main types of loops: `for` and `while`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Looping Over Different Data Types\n",
    "You can use `for` loops to iterate over lists, strings, tuples, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for char in \"hello\":\n",
    "    print(char)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## The `range()` Function\n",
    "`range()` generates a sequence of numbers, often used in for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",

    "## The `else` Clause with Loops\n",
    "You can use `else` with loops. The `else` block runs if the loop completes without a `break`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",

    "# Practice\n",
    "- Write a loop to sum all numbers in a list.\n",
    "- Use a while loop to count down from 5 to 1.\n",
    "- Try using `else` with a loop and observe the behavior."
